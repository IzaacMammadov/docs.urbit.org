**Entropy** is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for
use in cryptography or other uses that require random data. In Urbit's case,
entropy is provided to [Arvo](/reference/glossary/arvo) by the runtime
[Vere](/reference/glossary/vere). The entropy is made available to
[agents](/reference/glossary/agent) and [threads](/reference/glossary/thread) as
the `eny` value in the [bowl](/reference/glossary/bowl). It's also available as
`eny` in the [dojo](/reference/glossary/dojo) and `%say`/`%ask`
[generators](/reference/glossary/generator).
