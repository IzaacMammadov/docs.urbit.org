A **cold atom** is an [atom](/reference/glossary/atom) whose type is an exact
value equal to itself. This in contrast to a [warm
atom](/reference/glossary/warm-atom), whose type is a general
[aura](/reference/glossary/aura). Cold atoms have a `%` prefix, for example
`%foo`, `%123`, `%0xdead.beef`, etc.
