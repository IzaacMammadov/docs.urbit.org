The [hood](/reference/glossary/hood) [agent](/reference/glossary/agent) is
divided into three separate sub-apps: `%drum`, `%kiln` and `%helm`. **Helm**
provides an interface to various system settings, functions and reports. Helm
can give memory reports, control kernel message verbosity, ping other ships,
manage [moons](/reference/glossary/moon), etc. Most of these functions are
exposed in the [dojo](/reference/glossary/dojo) with Hood
[generators](/reference/glossary/generator) (`|mass`, `|verb`, `|hi`, `|moon`,
etc).
