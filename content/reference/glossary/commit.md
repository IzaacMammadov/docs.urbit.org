[Clay](/reference/glossary/clay) is [Arvo's](/reference/glossary/arvo)
revision-controlled filesystem, and a **commit** is a particular
change/revision. [Desks](/reference/glossary/desk) may be mounted to the host
(Unix/Windows) filesystem, their files edited, and the resulting changes
committed with the `|commit` generator in the [dojo](/reference/glossary/dojo).
