Welcome to the Operator's Manual for the Urbit project.

This documentation provides a series of guides and reference material for
assisting you in the usage and operations of your ship.

## [Urbit OS](/manual/os/)

This section describes how to interact with your running Urbit ship: this
includes working with the filesystem, command line (`dojo`), resolving common
issues, and more.

## [Urbit ID](/manual/id/)

Urbit ID is our [public-key infrastructure](/manual/id), which is
what allows you to truly own your identity. Here you'll find guides for
interacting with your Urbit ID via our [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org)
application.

## [Running Urbit](/manual/running/)

Urbit can be run in a variety of contexts. Our [Getting Started
Guide](https://urbit.org/manual/getting-started/) covers how to run an Urbit locally
on your computer; this section covers alternative ways of running Urbit.
