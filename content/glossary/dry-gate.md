A **dry gate** is a [gate](/reference/glossary/gate) that only accepts an
argument of the type it explicitly specified. This is in contrast to a [wet
gate](/reference/glossary/wet-gate), which can accept arguments of different
types and transparently pass them through. The typical
[rune](/reference/glossary/rune) for a dry gate is `|=`.
