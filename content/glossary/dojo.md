The **Dojo** is Urbit's command-line application that processes system commands
and returns output. It also runs [Hoon](/reference/glossary/hoon) and
[Nock](/reference/glossary/nock) code, making it a good place to play around
with those languages.

The Dojo is the first thing you encounter after successfully booting your
[ship](/reference/glossary/ship).
