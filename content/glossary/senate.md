The **Galactic Senate** is the body of all [galaxies](/reference/glossary/galaxy) that governs
[Azimuth](/reference/glossary/azimuth) by [majority vote](/reference/glossary/voting). There are two types of
votes: an [upgrade proposal](/reference/glossary/upgrade), which is a motion to update the logic
of Azimuth (i.e. [Ecliptic](/reference/glossary/ecliptic)), and a [document
proposal](/reference/glossary/docvote), which is a motion to legitimize or approve the content of an
arbitrary document.
