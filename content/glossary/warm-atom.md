A **warm atom** is an [atom](/reference/glossary/atom) with an ordinary
[aura](/reference/glossary/aura). The type of a warm atom is, conceptually, the
set of all possible values for that aura. For example, the
[cord](/reference/glossary/cord) `'foo'` nests under the type of the cord
`'bar'` - they both have `@t` auras. This is in contrast to a [cold
atom](/reference/glossary/cold-atom), where its type is an exact value.
