A **wrapper** is a library that takes a [Gall](/reference/glossary/gall)
[agent](/reference/glossary/agent) [core](/reference/glossary/core) as its
argument, augmenting the functionality of the agent. The most common agent
wrapper is the `dbug` library, which adds debugging functionality to an agent.
