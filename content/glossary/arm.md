An **arm** is a named Hoon expression in a [core](/reference/glossary/core). A
core contains one or more arms. If a core is thought of as an object in an
object-oriented language, its arms can be thought of as its methods.

Arms are one of the two types of [wing](/reference/glossary/wing) in the
[subject](/reference/glossary/subject), the other being a
[leg](/reference/glossary/leg).
