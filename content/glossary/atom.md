An **atom** is any non-negative integer of any size. The atom is the most basic data type in [Nock](/reference/glossary/nock) and [Hoon](/reference/glossary/hoon).

A Hoon atom type consists of a Nock atom with two additional pieces of metadata:
an _aura_, which is a soft type that declares if an atom is a date, a ship name,
a number, etc, and an optional constant. A Hoon atom type is _warm_ or _cold_
based on whether or not the constant exists:

- A Hoon atom type is [warm](/reference/glossary/warm-atom) if the constant is `~`
  (null), any atom is in the type.
- A Hoon atom type is [cold](/reference/glossary/cold-atom) if the constant is `[~
  atom]`, its only legal value is the exact value of the atom.
