**Aqua** is something like Docker but for Urbit; it is a virtualization tool whose primary purpose is testing and development.

Aqua is a [Gall](/reference/glossary/gall) app that runs an [Arvo](/reference/glossary/arvo) instance or instances in userspace. It pretends to be [Vere](/reference/glossary/vere), and as such it loads [pills](/reference/glossary/pill) to boot up a virtual ship or fleet of ships and then manages them from within the parent Arvo instance. Running tests for a virtual fleet of Aqua ships is done using [pH](/reference/glossary/ph).

Aqua is jetted with the usual [Nock](/reference/glossary/nock) interpreter and thus virtual ships do not run any slower than the parent ship.
