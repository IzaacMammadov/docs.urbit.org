Hoon Academy is the live, cohort based Hoon course offered by the Urbit Foundation. With a hands-on instructor, exercises and feedback, office hours and discussions, Hoon Academy will be the best way for most to get started as an Urbit developer.

The course is offered a few times per year, with the next cohort starting in Fall of 2024. 

The syllabus from our last offering [is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQL4B59B0uK75KFSErb-BFJ8pbhVxyoyA1tRiv4RBlc/edit?usp=sharing).

Hoon Academy graduates will be well-positioned to read and interpret most Hoon code, produce useful standalone code of their own, and start exploring the Urbit system for app development or core development.
